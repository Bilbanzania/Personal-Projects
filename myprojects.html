            The first section I added JavaScript is on the home page. If you click inside the div
            container, you can change the background color between gray and black. It uses toggle to switch between the
            two colors.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            The second section I used JavaScript is on the about us page. When you hover over (or tap) the div
            element that has
            gradient styling, it changes the gradient. This is done by using jquery.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            The third section I used JavaScript is on the contact page. There I created a form asking for a first name,
            email and comment. The JavaScript I used does not allow you to continue with the form unless everything has
            been filled out. Once every field has input, it will then allow the user to send out an email.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            The fourth section I covered was the visitor count where it adds how many people have visited the page. I
            tried working it to count for the whole site but couldn't quite get it. Onload it calls on a function that
            adds to a variable increasing the count. Right now though, it only counts the visitors through the device
            you are using, so it will only show one visitor.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            The last section I added JavaScript is on the Slideshows page. It uses Jquery to transistion between
            pictures within div elements. It mainly uses intervals, fadein(), and fadeout() functions.
