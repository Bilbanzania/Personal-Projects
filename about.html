                Computers have always interested me since I was a little kid. I built my first computer from two old <a
                    href="https://microsoft.fandom.com/wiki/Windows_95" target="_blank" class="linkColor">Windows 95
                    computers</a> and kept learning from there. I did not start learning any kind of markup language
                until I
                was old enough to have a <a href="https://myspace.com/" target="_blank" class="linkColor">Myspace.</a>
                From
                there I learned just enough HTML to make my own Metallica background.
                That is when I started to gain interest in programming. In high school I learned just enough visual
                basic to
                make the DVD drive pop out and confuse people. After high school it was still definitely a hobby to just
                try
                stuff with until I started college.
                I started with Java in the back-end realm of things, but it never really sparked interest. I decided to
                try
                front-end coding and absolutely love it.
                I think my end goal is to become a UX/UI front-end developer, the design aspect is what I really enjoy.
                To
                me, it is amazing you can code websites and make them look the way they do. Below is an example of some
                of
                the cool things you can do with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, just hover your mouse (tap if mobile) in and out of
                the
                box below!
